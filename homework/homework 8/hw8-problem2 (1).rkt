; Problem 2
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; IMPORTANT:
; 1. The functions that you design for this problem *must* use the ISL list
;    abstraction(s); you MAY NOT use recursion: doing so will lead you to get
;    no code credit for the function :(
;
; 2. The planning part of this problem is in the SAME file used for ALL parts
;    of Homework 8.


; Your task here will be to design the function elim-contains-char, which takes
; a list of strings and produces a list of the same strings, in the same order,
; but excluding those strings that contain a supplied character (represented as
; a 1String). For clarity, here is the intended signature:

; elim-contains-char : 1String [List-of String] -> [List-of String]

; Note: For purposes of this problem, you should NOT use string-contains? (or
;       similar). Instead, use the explode function to treat the supplied
;       string as a list of characters (each represented as a 1String).


; TODO 1/2: Plan your solution, using the planning interface described on the
;           canvas page for this assignment. ALL PLANNING FOR THIS HW WILL BE
;           DONE IN THE SAME PLACE, AND SUBMITTED TOGETHER.

; TODO 2/2: Design the function elim-contains-char using the ISL list
;           abstractions. YOUR CODE SHOULD NOT USE ANY RECURSION.


(define LOS-0 '())
(define LOS-1 '("steast" "iv" "curry" "churchills" "stwest"))

; elim-contains-char : 1String [List-of String] -> [List-of String]
; removes strings containing the given character

(check-expect (elim-contains-char "e" LOS-0) '()) 
(check-expect (elim-contains-char "x" LOS-1) LOS-1)
(check-expect (elim-contains-char "a" LOS-1) '("iv" "curry" "churchills" "stwest"))
(check-expect (elim-contains-char "c" LOS-1) '("steast" "iv" "stwest")) 

(define (elim-contains-char 1s los) 
  (local [; doesnt-contain-char?: String-> Boolean
          ; checks if the String contains a character
          ; given: "discrete", where 1s is "a", expect #t
          ; given: "fundies", where 1s is "f", expect #f
          (define (doesnt-contain-char? str) 
            (not (ormap (Î» (x) (string=? x 1s)) (explode str))))]     
            (filter doesnt-contain-char? los)))
