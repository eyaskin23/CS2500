; Problem 3
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; IMPORTANT:
; 1. The functions that you design for this problem *must* use the ISL list
;    abstraction(s); you MAY NOT use recursion: doing so will lead you to get
;    no code credit for the function :(
;
; 2. The planning part of this problem is in the SAME file used for ALL parts
;    of Homework 8.


; Your task in this problem is to help fishing boat skippers adhere to strict
; rules about fishing in the United States. In particular, catching and keeping
; a fish that is below a certain size can result in a hefty fine. However, these
; rules don't apply to any fish designed as an "invasive species." (In fact, in
; many locations, the act of releasing these fish back into the wild carries its
; own fine!)

; For a fishing boat skipper to know that they are following the above rules for
; fish to release, they must keep track their fish and at every point in time on
; the trip, they need to be able to determine which non-invasive fish in their
; catch are above the minimum size restriction (we'll use 8 inches). For this
; purpose, a catch is represented with the following data definition:


(define-struct fish [species length-in-inches])

; A Fish is a (make-fish String PosNum)
; Interpretation: name of fish and length in inches.

(define FISH-1 (make-fish "Carp" 20))
(define FISH-2 (make-fish "Guppy" 1))
(define FISH-3 (make-fish "Lake Trout" 8))
(define FISH-4 (make-fish "Snakehead" 10))

(define (fish-temp f)
  (... (fish-species f) ...
       (fish-length-in-inches f) ...))


; Your task is to design the function viable-fish, which takes in a list of
; caught fish and a list of names of invasive species (represented as strings)
; and returns a list, in the same order as the input, of the non-invasive fish
; that are larger than 8 inches.


; TODO 1/2: Plan your solution, using the planning interface described on the
;           canvas page for this assignment. ALL PLANNING FOR THIS HW WILL BE
;           DONE IN THE SAME PLACE, AND SUBMITTED TOGETHER.

; TODO 2/2: Design the function viable-fish using the ISL list abstractions.
;           YOUR CODE SHOULD NOT USE ANY RECURSION.

(check-expect (viable-fish '() (list "Lake Trout" "Snakehead")) '())
(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-1) (list "Lake Trout" "Snakehead")) (list FISH-1))
(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-1) '()) (list FISH-1))
(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-2) (list "Lake Trout" "Snakehead")) '())
(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-2) '()) '()) 

(define (viable-fish lof invasive)
  (local [; viable? Fish -> Boolean
          ; is the fish over 8 inches and non-invasive?
          ; given FISH-3 where invasive is '(), expect #t
          ; given FISH-2 where invasive is '("Lake Trout" "Snakehead"), expect #f
          (define (viable? f)
            (and (> (fish-length-in-inches f) 8)
                 (not (ormap (Î» (spec) (string=? (fish-species f) spec)) invasive))))]
    (filter viable? lof)))
