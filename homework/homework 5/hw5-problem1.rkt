; Problem 1
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; You are going to make yourself a useful interactive app: flash cards
; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard).

; To begin, consider the following data definition...


(define-struct flashcard [front back])

; A FlashCard is a (make-flashcard String String)
; Interpretation: the front and back of a card


; TODO 1/4: Complete the design recipe for FlashCard.
; 





; Now a single flash card wouldn't be super useful, and so...

; TODO 2/4: Design ListOfFlashCard (LoFC) to support an arbitrarily sized
;           sequence of flash cards. Importantly...
;           - These should be proper lists (i.e., using cons and '()).
;           - Make sure to give yourself a few example lists, of different sizes;
;             hopefully they are useful in your classes!
;           - Remember that your LoFC template should reflect that your list
;             elements are themselves designed types (FlashCard).




; Now, for practice...

; TODO 3/4: Design the function has-text?, which determines if a list of flash
;           cards contains any card that contains a supplied text.
;
;           Hint: the string-contains? function is very useful for determining
;           if one string contains another :)




; Finally, let's put this list to use :)

; TODO 4/4: Design the program go-cards, which helps you study with a supplied list
;           of cards. It starts on the first card and then flips it when a key is
;           pressed, and then goes to the front of the next card when another key is
;           pressed. The program should end when the last card has been flipped, and
;           the go-cards function should return how many cards were in the original
;           list. Some hints...
;           - To get you started, you have been supplied the data definition of a
;             way to represent the state of the program (don't forget to uncomment
;             the structure definition and finish the design recipe for data!).
;           - The return value of this function is a bit challenging, since the list
;             you get at the end is empty! So uncomment the code we've given you below,
;             but to understand: you can *add* the length of the originally supplied
;             list to that of the (empty) final list and still get the right answer :)
;           - Be sure to follow the templates for all your data, which will typically
;             entail helpers for the FS, the LoFC, and the FC.
;           - As long as the program operates as described, you are welcome to make it
;             look as simple or as creative as you would like - we hope it helps you
;             in your classes!! :)


; (define-struct fs [cards front?])

; A FlashState (FS) is a (make-fs LoFC Boolean)
; Interpretation: a list of cards, and whether
; the front is face up


; go-cards : LoFC -> Nat
; displays the cards in sequence (flip via key),
; returning the number of cards

(define (go-cards lofc)

   (length lofc)
